## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Problem1

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins") 
```

## Description of the penguins dataset

```{r}
#variables included in this dataset
names(penguins)

#statistical summary
skimr::skim(penguins)

#number of rows
nrow(penguins)

#number of columns
ncol(penguins)
```

There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the penguins dataset. Important variables recorded in this dataset include: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. 
The mean flipper lengths is 200.01520 mm. 

## Scatter plot

```{r}
#plot flipper length (y) vs bill length (x) and color with species
plot_penguins = 
  tibble(penguins,
    x = bill_length_mm,
    y = flipper_length_mm
  )

ggplot(plot_penguins, aes(x = x, y = y, color=species)) + geom_point() + xlab("bill length in mm") + ylab("flipper length in mm") + ggtitle("Distribution of Bill and Flipper Length in Penguins by Species")

#Export scatterplot to project directory using ggsave
ggsave("first_scatterplot.pdf")
```

## Problem 2

## Create a data frame

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#creating data frame using tibble
df = 
  tibble(
    a = rnorm(10, mean=0, sd=1),
    a > 0,
    c = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    d = factor(c("red","yellow","blue","blue","yellow","red","red","yellow","blue","red"))
  )

#check dataframe
df
```
A data frame with 10 rows and 4 columns was produced. 

## Take mean of coloums in df
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#using pull to pull out column from df

a <- df %>% pull(a)
c <- df %>% pull(c)

mean(a)

```
When extracting the columns above with pull(), R only allows numeric vector and characteristic vector to be extracted. And for the mean() function, only numeric and logical arguments can be insered. Since c is a character vector, we will only obtain the mean for the numeric vector. The mean for a is -0.1012498. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#using as.numeric to convert data type

b = as.numeric(a>0)
c = as.numeric(c)
d = as.numeric(d)

mean(b)
mean(c)
mean(d)
```
When converting character vectors to numeric with as.numeric, NA were produced. This means the character vectors are not formatted as numbers and we can not get an average from it.

The mean for the logistic vector is 0.5, and the mean for the factor vector is 2.
